# Secret Old Man
This monstrosity is a Chrome extension that hides a tiny little picture of an old man somewhere on every website you visit.
Find him and click on him before it's too late!
Also sometimes it doesn't work, so don't spend *too* much time looking for the old man when there is a very real chance he is not there at all.

## Installation
Because this is not yet on the Chrome store, the only way to install is through manual installation. Just follow these steps:
* Clone this repo
* Go to `chrome://extensions`, and make sure that the developer mode toggle is active
* Click `Load unpacked`, and select the directory of this repo

You'll be searching for old men in no time!
